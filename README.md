# Q-A-Chatbot-USing-LLM

In this project, I developed a chatbot that answers questions based on documents using a combination of advanced tools and libraries. The core components include:

- **Langchain**: This helps structure the chatbot’s ability to handle conversation flow and language modeling efficiently.
- **OpenAI API**: It powers the chatbot's natural language processing (NLP) capabilities for generating human-like responses.
- **Huggingface Hub**: It provides access to various models for fine-tuning and enhancing the chatbot’s performance.
- **Python-dotenv**: This is used for managing environment variables, such as API keys, securely.
- **Streamlit**: The chatbot interface was built using Streamlit, providing a simple and interactive web-based UI for users to ask questions and receive responses from the chatbot.

The chatbot is designed to interact with documents, extracting and processing relevant information to provide insightful answers to user queries. This project highlights skills in natural language processing, API integration, and web development, making it a versatile tool for document-based question-answering tasks.
